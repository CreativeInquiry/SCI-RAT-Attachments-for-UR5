- Synopsis

- During the Spring of 2016, the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative

- Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University acquired an advanced UR5

- robotic arm for use in experimental arts and technology research.

- A small team of artists and engineers joined forces and formed

- SCI-RAT (STUDIO for Creative Inquiry Robotic Arm Team) to explore

- a variety of interesting applications not typically associated

- with industrial robotic arms.

- The people on the team were Madeline Gannon, Dan Moore, Epic

- Jefferson, Benjamin Snell, Golan Levin, Tom Hughes, and John Choi.

- The last person on this list was responsible for creating a

- variety of low-cost, 3D-printable end effectors for the robot arm.

- This document, authored by John Choi, contains detailed notes on

- every adapter created over the course of the 2016 Spring semester.

- The following files are included for every adapter:

[.3dm] The original CAD files made in Rhino.

- All 3d printed attachments use M6x12 size screws to connect to the

- front plate of the robot. If attachments are stacked (for example,

- Gripper with Breadboard Adapter), M6x20 size screws should be used

- instead. Note that some attachments have multiple components to be

- assembled, separated due to limitations of 3D printing technology.

- For these parts, SAE 4-40 size screws and nuts should be used to

- fasten components together.

- Rod Adapter

- This attachment is designed to connect to any rod-shaped object

- less than 15 millimeters in diameter. This includes pens, pencils,

- markers, spoons, laser pointers and more. Rods can be attached

- either vertically or horizontally, held in place by a set screw.

- Other objects can be strapped to the rod adapter with cable ties.

- Camera Mount

- This attachment is designed to adapt to any device that can be

- mounted on a standard tripod (diameter 1/4" with 16 threads).

- There are 4 slots on the camera mount for various device sizes.

- Example devices that can be mounted are HERO cameras, camcorders,

- microphones, laser rangefinders and more.

- Breadboard Mount

- This is a standard attachment that mounts to a full-size

- breadboard (5.5 cm x 17 cm) onto the end of the UR5. This

- attachment allows one to prototype basic electronics with the

- robot and attach a variety of custom sensors and actuators. Due to

- the impermanent nature of solderless breadboard connections, pins

- may fall out with enough shock or vibration, therefore it is

- advised to move the robot slowly while using this attachment.

- Enclosed Arduino Cube

- For projects that need more protection than what the open-ended

- Breadboad mount offers, the Enclosed Arduino Cube is recommended

- as an alternative. This attachment is fairly complex and there are

- many things to consider while using it on the UR5, listed below:

- 0) An Arduino UNO sits on the left face.

- 1) USB or an HC-06 bluetooth module is used for communication.

- 2) A 6,9, or 12 volt battery pack can be placed on the right.

- 3) On the front is a standard 5.5 cm x 17 cm breadboard.

- 4) The Arduino Mount has three screws on the left face.

- 5) When the left three screws are removed, it folds open.

- 6) When closed, there is one open side to allow wires to go out.

- 7) Four of the five sides can connect to another UR5 attachment.

- 8) The attachment must be open to attach/remove to the UR5.

- 9) Maximum supported weight is roughly 1000g (2 water bottles).

- Googly Eye Double Mount

- This is a playful attachment that gives the UR5 robot some

- personality with a set of two big googly eyes. A pair of screws on

- the far left and right sides holds the googly eyes together. This

- attachment comes in two pieces. In order to attach to the robot,

- the first piece must be screwed onto the UR5's front plate before

- screwing on the second piece.

- Googly Eye Single Mount

- This is the one-eyed variant of the Googly Eye Mount. A set of

- four screws on the upper and lower left and right tabs holds the

- Googly Eye together. Due to the large size of the Googly Eye,

- there are 6 components that need to be assembled together to form

- the attachment. Once assembled, this can be screwed directly onto

- the UR5's front base plate.

- Ryobi Caulk Gun Adapter

- Custom-fabricated to enable Madeline Gannon's experimental "3D

- printing on the human body" research work, this device is built on

- top of a linear actuator extracted from a Ryobi Motorized Caulk

- Gun Extruder, adapted to dispense high-viscosity semi-solid clay

- material at various positions and orientations controlled by the

- UR5 robot arm. This attachment needs to be paired with the

- Breadboard mount and a 12 volt power source in order to work. To

- attach onto the robot, the Breadboard mount stacked with the first

- piece should be screwed onto the front plate of the robot with

- four M6x20 screws. Once this has been completed, the second piece

- (attached to the linear actuator and motor driver) can be screwed

- on with three M6x12 screws. While this attachment is fairly strong

- (five 4-40 screws hold the linear actuator in place), it is highly

- recommended to move the robot arm in a slow and predictable

- fashion while using this attachment.

- Silly String Adapter

- Built at Dan Moore's request, this attachment holds a canister of

- Silly String with a servomechanism to control the spray valve. The

- motor is a standard-size hobby servo that can be controlled by an

- Arduino. This attachment can be used in conjunction with the

- Breadboard mount. Note that this is a derivative of Thingiverse

- user sliptonic's Servo controlled Silly-String trigger:

- Tattoo Adapter

- The STUDIO has recently acquired a tattoo etcher for artistic

- experiments in permanent body etching. Of particular interest was

- the ability to automate with the precision of a robotic arm. The

- Tattoo Adapter attachment fixes the tattoo etcher onto the UR5

- robotic arm with a simple screw-on plate. As the robot arm is very

- powerful, it is advised to move it very slowly when in close

- proximity to humans.

- Threading Machine

- Like the Ryobi Caulk Gun Adapter, the threading machine is another

- piece of custom hardware for use in Madeline Gannon's research.

- The threading machine is designed to rapidly wrap two threads of

- string around a human arm. As the arm passes through the hollow

- center of the device, the threading machine rapidly spins a large

- hollow gear with rolls of string around the arm, resulting in an

- arm covered in lots of string. Note that this is the second

- version of the design – gears work better than roller wheels.

- Gripper Mount

- Since the beginning of robotic arms, the standard thing to attach

- to any robotic arm is a standard gripper. As such, a standard 3D-

- printable gripper was designed for use with the UR5 robot arm.

- High-torque metal geared servomotors give the gripper a lot of

- force, and it is expected to be able to hold roughly 1kg (2 water

- bottles) of mass. The best part: the Gripper Mount is a fraction

- of the cost of industry standard robotic grippers.

- CV Effector

- This attachment is a triangular plate with three infrared

- identification spheres for use in computer vision applications.

- When used in conjunction with an infrared marker suit, this allows

- for creative human-robot interactions so that the robot knows

- exactly where the human is in relation to itself. Note that this

- attachment requires both a 3D-printed base mount and a laser-cut

- triangular plate in order to fabricate.

- Finger Mount

- Artificial human body part attachments allow the robot to

- literally become more human-like. An experiment in crossing the

- boundaries of the uncanny valley, the body part attachments are a

- twist on the common cyborg: instead of attaching robotic parts

- onto a human, we attach humanoid body parts onto a robot. The

- results are quite unsettling. The first of these attachments is

- the Finger Mount, allowing the robot to point at people.

- Hand Mount

- The hand mount is the second body part attachment. It actually is

- a creative reuse of the universal Rod Adapter by Dan Moore,

- fastened to a rubber hand with generous amounts of superglue.

- Head Mount

- The third and last of the human-robot body part attachments is the

- Head Mount, and it is easily the most unsettling of the three.

- This attachment prints in two parts: the first piece is fixed to

- the back of the rubber head with three screws, and the second

- piece is fixed the to UR5 robot arm with four screws. The two

- pieces are joined together with two screws down the middle.
